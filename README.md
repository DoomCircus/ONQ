About OnQ:
======================================================================================================================
OnQ is an educational tool that incorporates the basic strategy of repetition and gamification to improve a students performance. It is a platform for instructors and students of all types to create, edit and share question and answer pairs in the form of digital cue cards. These cue cards can be sent to users as SMS, MMS, and email notifications so that
they can take studying on-the-go.
